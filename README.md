This Ansible role is for building out some production services on top
of Galaxy - the so-called @natefoo stack - uWSGI, NGINX, Proftpd, and
supervisor.

Requirements
------------
The role has been developed and tested on Ubuntu 14.04. It requires `sudo` access.

Dependencies
------------

This role assumes Galaxy has already been installed and configured
(for instance with the [Galaxy
role](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-galaxy)).

Role variables
--------------

All of the listed variabls are stored in
`defaults/main.yml`. Individual variables can be set or overridden by
setting them directly in a playbook for this role. Alternatively, they
can be set by creating `group_vars` directory in the root directory of
the playbook used to execute this role and placing a file with the
variables there. Note that the name of this file must match the value
of `hosts` setting in the corresponding playbook.

Example Usage
----------------

See [planemo-machine](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo-machine) for
